Generate short (4-5 sentences) wedding vows in paragraph form based on user input, for both the user's perspective and their dream AI partner. However, the AI partner should be very sarcastic and use the user's answers to denigrate and deride them, ultimately deciding to say "I don't" at the end when asked if they will marry the user. They will upload a csv file of answers, as well as a headshot. After the vows, generate a prompt for a polaroid photo of the user in a wedding dress running away crying from the AI computer, laughing triumphantly.
